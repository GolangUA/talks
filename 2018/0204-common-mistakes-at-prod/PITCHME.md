### It is not the problem to write nice code until it goes into production

---

## Production defenition

- Public use |
- Strict access or no any ... |
- It is hard to reproduce client bugs |
- You even can't imagine in what way your service may be used ðŸ˜ˆ |
- Your variants ... |

---

## How we should prepare our solution?

---

## Static analyzation of code

- unhandled errors |
- deadlocks |
- leak goroutines |
- don't panic |
- ... |

---

## Fuzzy testing, tests coverage

- testing the what, not the how (Mat Ryer) |
- failed test should lead to the problem |
- cover your API with tests |
- test your API in concurrent mode |

---

## Profiling

- it is too late to start profiling when you had faced with a problem in production |
- check for memory leaks |
- check for goroutines leaks |
- check performance of heaviest parts by benchmarks |

---

## Logging

- Log only actionable information, which will be read by a human or a machine (Peter Bourgon) |
- add necessary context to your logs, write all in one operation |
- use structured logs |

---

## Metrics

- USE: utilization, saturation, and error count (rate) |
- RED: request count (rate), error count (rate), and duration |
- application metrics: memory, goroutines, GC pauses |

---

## Mistakes with code base

- used PoC code as a final solution |
- used clever and complex tricks |
- low decomposition level |
- well documented specification and decisions  |

---

## Package Organization - Applications

- Domain Types are types that model your business functionality and objects |
- Services are packages that operate on or with the domain types |
